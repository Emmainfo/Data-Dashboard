# SkillToScaleUp — Working Prototype

This is a small, self-contained static prototype of the SkillToScaleUp website:
- `index.html` — Dashboard (demo data + SVG charts)
- `login.html` — Login page (simple demo form)
- `styles.css` — Shared styles
- `app.js` — Dashboard demo JS

## How to host on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public or private).
2. Upload the files in this folder to the repository root (or push with git).
3. In the repository settings enable **Pages** and select the `main` (or `master`) branch / root directory.
4. After a minute your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Notes
- All charts are implemented with inline SVG and demo data (no external libraries).
- This is a static prototype intended for design/demo purposes. Replace data fetching with your API calls to connect it to real data.
